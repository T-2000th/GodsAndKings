  tou_the_cathar_king_title:0 "The Cathar King"
  tou_the_cathar_king_desc:0 "Guilhem, despite being outwardly Catholic and propping up the Roman Catholic Church as the state religion officially, has become more and more engrossed in the beliefs and systems of the Cathar faith in the past few years, even going as far as to secretly being practicing it. The rumors have already begun spreading, and before long, we must make a choice: do we embrace Cathar belief and finally renounce the lingering effects of the failed crusade, or do we finally finish the crusade in order to appeal to the wider world?"

  tou_look_outwards_desc:0 "Due to our harbouring of the Cathars, much of the outside world has scorned us and refuses to be associated much if any with our government, leaving us in a precarious position. We must work to resolve this, establishing new alliances and building a formidable force in order to ensure that we are properly respected on the European stage."

  tou_lion_of_bordeaux_title:0 "Lion of Bordeaux"
  tou_lion_of_bordeaux_desc:0 "Practically ever since we came into existence, the Duchy of Aquitaine has had ambitions onto us and has been a thorn in our side due to their access to valuable trade... and their ability to cut us off from it. We have never been able to counter them, but now the tides appear to have begun to shift, with Aquitaine having slowly begun to weaken and us having begun to grow stronger. Let us put down the Lion of Bordeaux and reap the rewards."
  mr_tou_events.1.t:0 "The City of Bordeaux"
  mr_tou_events.1.d:0 "Bordeaux, the city at the water's edge between the rivers Garonne and Dordogne, has grown into quite the metropolis and trade hub under Aquitain rule, with it having been a source of envy for many Toulousain architects and merchants. It's naturally advantageous spot between two rivers has left Toulouse lagging behind, especially after the damages wrought by the failed crusade. Despite our envy over the prosperity of Bordeaux, we have never been able to seriously compete with Aquitaine enough to dream of seizing it for ourselves... until now. The city walls have fallen, and now, it is time for us to decide how we will use the city's resources.\n\nWe could encoruage it's growth, and in essence establish it as a second court alongside Toulouse... or we could funnel it's profits right into Toulouse itself."

  tou_avenge_raymond_title:0 "Avenge Raymond"
  tou_avenge_raymond_desc:0 "During the crusades, we were forced to flee into our Provencal holdings as knights pursued Raymond VI and his son. Whilst we were able to push the French back and ultimately secured our position, the same can not be said of our lands along the Rhone. The Dukes of Barcelona marched across the Rhone and took what he held by force, and despite our best efforts, it is due to their victory that the decaying Francien corpse holds onto Provence even now. Let us avenge this disgraceful defeat by taking Provence in it's entirety."
  mr_tou_events.2.t:0 "The Marquisate of Provence"
  mr_tou_events.2.d:0 "Whilst we held considerable portions of Provence, it had been divided between two different entities, one ruled by the Dukes of Barcelona, the County, and one ruled by us, the Marquisate. The latter ceased to exist when Ramon Berenguer marched across the Rhine and defeated us, seizing the entirety of Provence for himself. However, due to his own failures and our assistance, they never quite managed to secure the entire region, and as such, Provence was left to be inherited by the decadent French crown due to Ramon's own marriage policies. Despite this, we haven't been able to secure the region for ourselves thanks for both our internal focus after the crusades and the influence of the French and Papacy. However, now that we have restored control, perhaps it's time to restore our old title in a new circumstance and with new intentions?"

These lands of great defensive value are sitting right on our border in the hands of the enemy! We cannot just let this enclave continue to exist; let us use the claims inherited from Aquitaine to put Gascony back into the hands of properly compotent rulers."

However, France themselves still hold considerable amount of lands, despite the autonomy it may have. As long as they have these lands, much of which used to be in the hands of the Duchy of Aquitaine, we cannot rest easy knowing that we have secured prosperity and stable governance in the region. We must push France past the Loire."

  tou_descend_upon_aragon_title:0 "Descend upon Aragon"
  tou_descend_upon_aragon_desc:0 "The very reason for Aragon and Catalonia's subserviance to the whale-hunting lunatics of Navarra is because of the fact that their last independent king decided he would fight upon the Pope's request for men to destroy our lands. However, much like the rest of the crusade, this ended in nothing but tragedy for the traitors, for he died here, and his realm fell into disarray. However, the damage he dealt has still lingered, and we have fought to rebuild ever since.\n\nHowever, now, the situation is different. We have always been rivaled to the Aragonese Kings, and as such we have finally marched all the way to the Pyrennes as to assert our might and secure ourselves against their new suzerain. However, some want us to go further. Why not?"
  mr_tou_events.3.t:0 "Descent upon the Kingdom of Aragon"
  mr_tou_events.3.d:0 "What the Aragonese did to us centuries ago has not been forgotten. Innocents upon innocents dead because of one man's blind devotion to a corrupt traitor sitting in Rome, and damage we have been working to rebuild for a long time, despite the Aragonese King's death in battle during his expedition. This is well-known by our men, who have been considering burning much of our newly acquired Aragonese possessions nearly to the ground as symbolic revenge for the Albigensian Crusade. However, we have been holding them back, specifically out of interest in propping up these lands as a new southern frontier, much as the Franks before us did in Catalonia against the Uyyammad Caliphs, only this time as a defensive border against the turmoil in Iberia.\n\nShall we utilize the zealotry of the Christian Iberian populace, or shall we get our sweet revenge?"

Whilst this was vague, it was hoped it was nothing of note. Sadly, this illusion was shattered when the missionaries started speaking.\n'Our [From.Monarch.GetTitle], Lord of Toulouse and Aquitaine, King of Aragon, Duke of Catalonia, Count of Provence, has sent us to request that you officially enshrine [Root.Religion.GetName] as the religion of government here in your prosperous [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName], for the sake of easing relations between our two realms.'\n\nNaturally, these demands have left a rather factionalized response in our court."

It has been prospering under Savoyard rule, but soon, we must go through Savoy in order to enact our revenge on the Pope for their betrayal in excommuniating Raymond VI, and it is not likely that Savoy, regardless of whatever heretical or anti-pope tenedecies they may have, will just let us march through and destablize the region.
