Our weary expedition members claim that bathing in the water refreshed them both physically and mentally, clearing most of the tiredness and all of the grime from their minds and bodies.

The first sight was a palisade encircling the town and smiles of greed was plastered on every face. These were soon exchanged for looks of disbeliefs and hearts turning to stone in their chests. The inhabitants were not white, were not clad in similar clothes to us and were certainly not wealthy. It was yet another tribe of natives, with more riches than most but this was no City of Gold."

 seven_cities_events.300.t:0 "The Woman Among Us"
 seven_cities_events.300.d:0 "While replenishing our supplies in $PROVINCENAME$, a young, pregnant woman and her husband, a well-known trapper, applied for the positions of interpreter and guide in our expedition. The woman speaks several languages while her husband is a good hunter with great knowledge of this continent."
 seven_cities_events.300.a:0 "Hire them."
 seven_cities_events.300.b:0 "We don't need them."
 seven_cities_events.301.t:0 "Saved by a Princess"
 seven_cities_events.301.d:0 "We cannot imagine the terror our conquistador must have felt when he laid his head onto a great stone while seeing men standing ready with clubs above his head. Luckily for him, the chief's dearest daughter rushed forth and placed her head upon his to save him from death."
 seven_cities_events.301.a:0 "We must make sure this does not happen again."
 seven_cities_events.301.b:0 "They are barbarians!"
 seven_cities_events.302.t:0 "Attacked by Natives"
 seven_cities_events.302.d:0 "Tragic news: our Explorer is dead! The expedition was traveling upriver by canoe when they encountered natives. The warlike tribe demanded that they come ashore and some of the men complied. They were disarmed and stripped naked, something our explorer objected to. He refused the orders and died riddled with bullets. The expedition members saw his body brought ashore and hacked to pieces. Only one survived, who was told to leave and run. The natives pursued him and he ran for his life. Naked, exhausted and bleeding, the survivor had only one assailant pursuing him after several miles. He managed to overcome the lone man and found shelter in $PROVINCENAME$."
 seven_cities_events.302.a:0 "How terrible!"
 seven_cities_events.303.t:0 "Lost in Mind and Space"
 seven_cities_events.303.d:0 "We should have realized that our conquistador had no sense of orientation at all the first two times he got lost. The first time, he went to retrieve two of our pack horses and got lost for sixteen days. If it hadn't been for some grapes and rabbits, he would have starved. He later told us that he thought he was behind the expedition and sped up to catch up with it, then he got hungry so he went downstream to look for a trading party. The expedition sent their best hunter to find him and were finally reunited with him. The second time he explored one of three forks of a river and disappeared for three days. Once again the expedition sent the seasoned hunter to find him and he told a tale of trying to backtrack the forks and following our trails. This made the crew decide that the conquistador would not be left alone to discover more parts of $PROVINCENAME$, but that still did not help. Only mere minutes later he was gone again."
 seven_cities_events.303.a:0 "Send the hunter out again."
 seven_cities_events.303.b:0 "Leave him. He'll have to find us this time."
 seven_cities_events.304.t:0 "A Dog's Life"
 seven_cities_events.304.d:0 "A big, black dog by the name of Seaman had accompanied the expedition from the start, and had experienced many adventures. A beaver had bit him so badly that the expedition's doctor had to perform surgery on his hind leg. Mosquitoes plagued the expedition and the dog had howled with the torture experienced by them. Natives in $PROVINCENAME$ had stolen Seaman but he was retrieved shortly. Our conquistador has grown fond of the dog and would be devastated if anything happened to him."
 seven_cities_events.304.a:0 "The tribes in $PROVINCENAME$ will know our wrath if anything happens to that dog!"
 seven_cities_events.304.b:0 "It's only a dog."
 seven_cities_events.305.t:0 "Faster, slowpokes!"
 seven_cities_events.305.d:0 "The natives of $PROVINCENAME$ have not been exactly friendly to our expedition. The ones we met tried to steal our weapons during the night and during the struggle two natives were killed. Our crew managed to flee over 100 miles in a day before they dared camp again. There are signs that the natives are after them once more, and they might find the strength to repeat the marathon march if encouraged..."
 seven_cities_events.305.a:0 "Flee, you fools!"
 seven_cities_events.306.t:0 "Waving the White Flag"
 seven_cities_events.306.d:1 "The [Root.Owner.GetName] and [rival_tribe.GetName] tribes are rivals, something our conquistador didn't realize until too late. They both demanded tribute from the expedition to allow them passage. By offering one native chief gifts first, our conquistador insulted and angered the other chief. The gifts offered were not to the chiefs' satisfaction and some warriors tried to take the expedition's provisions. The conquistador took a firm stand, and he and his second in command brandished their swords and threatened violence. The chiefs backed down and better gifts were presented to them both."
 seven_cities_events.306.a:0 "Try to make them bury the hatchet."
 seven_cities_events.306.b:0 "Good work!"
 seven_cities_events.307.t:0 "Bleeding Gums and Falling Teeth"
 seven_cities_events.307.d:0 "With a diet consisting mostly of cured and salted meat and dried grains, the malaise and lethargy should have been the first symptoms recognized as scurvy, but it was not until gums started bleeding and teeth falling out that we realized we had to do something to save our expedition members. As they are exploring provinces that have an unknown flora and fauna to us, it would be unwise to eat anything as it could be poisonous. Maybe we should try to establish contact with the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ and ask for their help?"
 seven_cities_events.307.a:0 "Trade for the medicine!"
 seven_cities_events.307.b:0 "No, try eating some fruit first."
 seven_cities_events.308.t:0 "The Amazons"
 seven_cities_events.308.d:0 "In $PROVINCENAME$ there are two small tribes with a very special arrangement: The women live by themselves, far from the men who they only allow to visit them a couple of times each year. Any boy child fathered this way is returned to the father and the girls are kept by the women. If approached at any other time than is appointed, the women will defend themselves with bows and arrows. The men of the strange tribe are currently preparing for the next visit, and have invited the male expedition members to join them."
 seven_cities_events.308.a:0 "That sounds like a bad idea."
 seven_cities_events.308.b:0 "This might be the only way to learn more about these strange customs."
 seven_cities_events.309.t:0 "Mutiny in $PROVINCENAME$!"
 seven_cities_events.309.d:0 "Several crew members of the conquistador's expedition were captivated by the idyllic life in $PROVINCENAME$ and decided to abandon the expedition. This was declared an act of mutiny by the conquistador and after a long hunt, the mutineers were captured. Should they be sent back to us and tried here, or should they be forgiven and allowed to return to the expedition as crew members after a bit of flogging?"
 seven_cities_events.309.a:0 "Send them back."
 seven_cities_events.309.b:0 "Flog them."
 seven_cities_events.310.t:0 "Wintering among the Natives"
 seven_cities_events.310.d:0 "In the province of $PROVINCENAME$, our conquistador encountered natives who proved so friendly and welcoming that he lost sight of the time spent among them. His expedition was forced to spend the winter with their native friends and allies, but built up relations in doing so."
 seven_cities_events.310.a:0 "He wasted time but gained friends... good."
 seven_cities_events.400.t:0 "The Survivor"
 seven_cities_events.400.d:0 "The expedition started with 600 men, but only four made it home alive. When they first arrived, the crew heard about another expedition where 450 of 600 men had perished. Fearing that they would face the same fate, many deserted. A hurricane struck the expedition not long after, and several men perished. Disaster after disaster struck the expedition, famine, disease and attacks from the natives. One of the four who returned home was Estevanico, a black slave born in Africa, who was taught by the conquistador the necessary skills to lead an expedition. He is available for hire, although we would suffer a small prestige hit if we appoint him our new conquistador."
 seven_cities_events.400.a:0 "Hire Estevanico, we need a new conquistador."
 seven_cities_events.400.b:0 "No, we will find a more suitable person for that."
 seven_cities_events.401.t:0 "Drunken Whiskey Thieves"
 seven_cities_events.401.d:0 "Found singing loud, lecherous songs and swigging whiskey straight from the bottle, the two men were clearly guilty of their crime. To steal whiskey and drink it while on duty - how unprofessional! They were tried in martial court and sentenced to flogging, then released."
 seven_cities_events.401.a:0 "They did not deserve a flogging!"
 seven_cities_events.401.b:0 "That taught them a lesson!"
 seven_cities_events.401.c:0 "Hopefully this did not avert them too long from their goal..."
 seven_cities_events.402.t:0 "Peralta Gold Mine"
 seven_cities_events.402.d:0 "The bloody massacre in $PROVINCENAME$ left few Peralta family members alive when natives attacked their routine gold expedition. The ones who survived have begged for the help of our conquistador and the soldiers of our expedition, promising much gold if their family is avenged."
 seven_cities_events.402.a:0 "Whatever they need - as long as we get that gold!"
 seven_cities_events.402.b:0 "The expedition has more pressing matters to attend to."
 seven_cities_events.403.t:0 "Gold and Diamonds"
 seven_cities_events.403.d:0 "The remaining members of the Peralta family led us to the place of the massacre. The bodies were left untouched, the wagons destroyed... Our expedition helped bury the bodies while several scouts searched the area for any signs of the attackers. A few clues led toward the Peralta gold mine and as they approached it became clear that the attackers had taken shelter in the mines. One of the Peraltas confirmed that it was the same group that had attacked them. After a violent battle, the enemy lay dead on the ground outside the mine. The Peralta family kept their word and rewarded us with a large amount of gold."
 seven_cities_events.403.a:0 "Honest pay for honest work."
 seven_cities_events.404.t:0 "Quartz and Pyrite"
 seven_cities_events.404.d:0 "The bodies of the fallen Peralta family members had been savaged, which made it difficult to identify them. Burying them took precious time, and the scout sent out to search the surrounding areas for the attackers returned with nothing. The oldest son of the Peraltas, one of the few survivors, refused to give up. He led the expedition towards the Peralta gold mine, in case the attackers had found their way there. As they approached the mine, their fears were confirmed. The mine is no more, the attackers buried it in rubble and the gold is lost. The Peralta family was avenged, as the large group of attackers were taken by surprise and easily killed."
 seven_cities_events.404.a:0 "That's... something, at least."
 seven_cities_events.405.t:0 "He's a Woman!"
 seven_cities_events.405.d:0 "We would never had discovered that Baret was a woman had the natives not shouted it at the top of their lungs when the expedition entered $PROVINCENAME$. She had joined us as an assistant to our naturalist and as his ulcerated leg had brought him much discomfort, she had carried supplies and specimens in his stead. Baret claims to be our naturalist's housekeeper, but their relationship seems deeper than that. Should we allow her to remain with us on the expedition?"
 seven_cities_events.405.a:0 "Yes, allow her to stay."
 seven_cities_events.405.b:0 "No, send her back!"
 seven_cities_events.406.t:0 "Poison Rock"
 seven_cities_events.406.d:0 "Nine horses died from eating poisonous plants, and the expedition was forced to leave behind two more who were near death. A cursed place with only poisonous plants and venomous animals and the conquistador regrets that they ever decided to camp there. A large rock formation provided shelter from the harsh winds that blew right through them, but Poison Rock, as it was named by the conquistador, is not a place for any man nor animal."
 seven_cities_events.406.a:0 "Continue on foot if you have to!"
 seven_cities_events.407.t:0 "False as diamonds of $PROVINCENAME$"
 seven_cities_events.407.d:0 "Our explorer has sent us gems he claims to have found in $PROVINCENAME$. White and glittering, he believes them to be diamond, but our learned scholars tell us that they are common quartz instead. Far from a source of wealth, they have become a source of ridicule..."
 seven_cities_events.407.a:0 "All is not diamonds that glimmer."
 seven_cities_events.408.t:0 "A Deserter Resurfaces!"
 seven_cities_events.408.d:0 "Words from our conquistador warned us that one of his trusted lieutenants had defected in despair at the state of the expedition. Our conquistador thought we had seen the last of this deserter, but our agents inform us that he has resurfaced and is peddling his charts to the merchants and explorers of our rival..."
 seven_cities_events.408.a:0 "Stop him, discreetly."
 seven_cities_events.408.b:0 "Kill him and make an example out of him!"
 seven_cities_events.409.t:0 "An account of the New Lands"
 seven_cities_events.409.d:0 "Our conquistador may not have sent back gold, but he has sent back a magnificently detailed map of our new domains, and of all the unclaimed land waiting only for brave settlers to claim their destiny..."
 seven_cities_events.409.a:0 "That's surprisingly good news, despite the lack of gold."
 seven_cities_events.410.t:0 "Abandoned Mounds"
 seven_cities_events.410.d:0 "From a distance, our conquistadors thought them to be mere hills standing among the otherwise empty plain in $PROVINCENAME$. But as we drew nearer, an enterprising fellow in the company noticed how regular they were, and he soon pointed out to his companions that they must be the remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people."
 seven_cities_events.410.a:0 "There must be gold underneath those hills! Dig them out, now!"
 seven_cities_events.410.b:0 "Leave them be, there's nothing but earth underneath them."
 seven_cities_events.411.t:0 "Nothing but dirt"
 seven_cities_events.411.d:0 "They were nothing but mere hills, that 'enterprising fellow' who thought them to be remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people was wrong. Dirt was all the expedition found."
 seven_cities_events.411.a:0 "How disappointing!"
 seven_cities_events.412.t:0 "Meager amount of Gold"
 seven_cities_events.412.d:0 "The hills were the remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people and the expedition found some gold in all that dirt. Although the expedition crew believed this to be a waste of time, and we do agree."
 seven_cities_events.412.a:0 "We got some gold, that's good."
 seven_cities_events.413.t:0 "Hic Sunt Dracones"
 seven_cities_events.413.d:0 "The paint on the great rock that dominates the river is almost faded, but the six-legged, monster it displays is still visible. Our natives tell us a fanciful tale of a dragon-like monster slain by their ancestors, but some of them confusedly insist the painting to be a warning that we should not head further. What is certain is that all of our native guides insist on discharging their weapons at the painted figure as we pass by it."
 seven_cities_events.413.a:0 "Let us conserve our ammunition."
 seven_cities_events.413.b:0 "Let us support their war on the beast."
 seven_cities_events.414.t:0 "A Most Deadly lake"
 seven_cities_events.414.d:0 "The natives whisper and throw evil glances toward the still water. They say that there is a spirit there, in the form of a great serpent or monster. They claim that this spirit ambushes canoes on the surface, pulling them to a watery grave. It may not be the work of monsters, but perhaps it would be wise to go the long way around?"
 seven_cities_events.414.a:0 "Go around it."
 seven_cities_events.414.b:0 "There are no such thing as monsters, take the fast way across."
 seven_cities_events.500.t:1 "The Cannibal Conquistador of [long_pig_country.GetName]"
 seven_cities_events.500.d:1 "[long_pig_country.GetName]'s conquistador has admitted that their expedition members ate human flesh! They tried to defend themselves by claiming that they had no idea what kind of meat they were offered by their host tribe, and that the name they were given had translated to 'long pig'."
 seven_cities_events.500.a:0 "Disgusting!"
 seven_cities_events.501.t:0 "Traditions Respected"
 seven_cities_events.501.d:0 "The conquistador from $FROMCOUNTRY$ was very respectful and took care to engage in our traditions in a correct manner."
 seven_cities_events.501.a:0 "That is important."
 seven_cities_events.502.t:0 "Insulted by Conquistador"
 seven_cities_events.502.d:0 "We are enraged by the behavior of the conquistador from $FROMCOUNTRY$! They managed to insult not only us and our traditions, but also our beliefs!"
 seven_cities_events.502.a:0 "They will be punished!"
 seven_cities_events.503.t:0 "Threatened by Conquistador"
 seven_cities_events.503.d:0 "Something caused the conquistador from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to erupt into accusations and threats of bodily harm! This is greatly disturbing."
 seven_cities_events.503.a:0 "Whatever had we done to deserve this?"
 seven_cities_events.504.t:0 "Friendly Conquistador"
 seven_cities_events.504.d:0 "$FROMCOUNTRY$ should have praise for their friendly conquistador, their visit to our province has only been profitable."
 seven_cities_events.504.a:0 "We will have to compliment them on that."
 seven_cities_events.505.t:0 "Peace brought by Conquistador"
 seven_cities_events.505.d:0 "The enmity between us and a neighboring country caused a visiting conquistador from [conquistador_country.GetName] to try and broker peace between us, which worked!"
 seven_cities_events.505.a:0 "We are astonished!"
 seven_cities_events.506.t:0 "Interfering Conquistador"
 seven_cities_events.506.d:0 "A conquistador from [conquistador_country.GetName] tried to force us and our rival to bury the hatchet! The enmity between us and the neighboring country has never been stronger, all thanks to that meddling person."
 seven_cities_events.506.a:0 "That's... surprising."
