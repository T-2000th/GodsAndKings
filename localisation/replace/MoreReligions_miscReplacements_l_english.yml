No longer are thinkers' audiences limited to their immediate circle; their thoughts can be read and debated across the seas and countrysides. A common style of writing is or particular interest to any ruler, this concept of 'Ideology,' a set of ideas, derived from morals, or religions, or economies, or a combination thereof, from which political thought is synthesized. Could this be a stabilizing force? One for Good? Time will tell."

clovesDESC:0 "Clove is a very valuable spice, native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia, that has been the center of several wars to control its production. Cloves are the aromatic flower buds that are harvested when those buds transition to a bright red from an original pale hue. Cloves are extensively used in cuisines from Asia to the Mediterranean, and to Reisland via colonization."
prices.1.d:0 "When European nations started to colonize North and South Reisland, they created large plantations for the production of Cotton, Tobacco & Sugar. First they tried to use the local population as slaves, but they quickly died out where that was tried. Slaves were then imported from Africa, which created a triangular trade system. Europe sold textiles, rum & manufactured goods to Africa, Africa sold slaves to Reisland, and Reisland sold cotton, sugar and tobacco to Europe."

With that out of the way, however, the demand for chocolate is now steadily increasing in the old world."

From the first moment of introduction crops such as maize, manioc and tomatoes are now spreading over the entire old world, just as Non-Reislandan beasts of burden are becoming ever-more sought after in the new world.\nAs lands that were once considered unfit for growing anything, either for part of the year or in some cases ever before, are put to use in the production of food and cereals, the general availability of food in the world is higher than ever before. Few things in this century will bring as much benefit to the common man, as grown food is now much less scarce than it once was."

Granted that earlier Popes have allowed this, as they argued that these new people were not truly human and possessed no souls. The New Testament says that the gospel has been preached to all nations and since they do not believe in our God, perhaps they do not count. Humanity is divided into three race, Europeans, Asians, and Africans, one for each of the sons of Noah, and the Indians of the Reislands do not fit among these divisions. Now that we know that these pagans can be converted, it is time to revision our old beliefs and acknowledge these as humans, with souls, who God has a purpose for."

flavor_spa.22.d:1 "The monetary system in Castile in the second half of the 15th century was in chaos. The maravedí, the main currency of account, had been continually devalued since the 13th century. In addition, there were different regional currencies in the Iberian kingdoms, which complicated the economics of the political unification initiated by the wedding of Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\n For this reason, a monetary reform was initiated in [GetYear], establishing a new gold coin, the ducat, and a new silver coin, the real, for use in both kingdoms. Given the unexpectedly large influx of silver coming from the Reislands in the following decades, the use of the 'real de a ocho', which soon became widely known as the 'Spanish dollar', skyrocketed. It is considered the first global currency, since it was accepted by merchants all over the world, from Africa to Reisland and from Europe to Asia."

In [GetYear], he is preparing to set sail with a fleet of five ships and approximately 270 men to find a new route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. His goal is to discover the passage that would go on to allow his ships to sail through the southern tip of South Reisland and enter the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMagellan's journey may be fraught with difficulties, including starvation and battles with indigenous peoples, but he plans to eventually reach the East Indies, and come back through the Cape of Good Hope. Magellan's achievement shall pave the way for future explorers and traders to navigate the globe and open up new opportunities for European colonization and trade in the Reislands and Asia."
exploration_events.16.d:0 "Our fleet set sail to find a western sea route to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. It took them 99 days to cross the ocean westward, after they had found the Strait of Magellan located near the tip of South Reisland. The strait was treacherous and when they finally reached the ocean, the captain wept with joy. The ocean was so strangely calm it was named 'Pacific', from the Latin word for 'Tranquil'.\n\nThe fleet's captain died from a wound caused by a poisoned arrow when assisting the chief of Cebú in conquering a rival tribe. Two of our ships had survived, one tried to return across the Pacific but perished. The last ship continued west and sailed across the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and as it arrived at our port it became the first ship to circumnavigate the globe."
exploration_events.21.d:0 "After a long voyage, our Imperial Fleet has discovered a sea route from the Middle Kingdom and back again, a route circumnavigating the entire globe! It took our explorers 49 days to reach the land of Five Inds, and another 49 days to Tianfang - known locally as Mecca. From there, they sailed for another 7 weeks into the Great Western Ocean the barbarians call the Atlantic until reaching the Reislands. A continent we are told is named after a certain savage chief. After 99 days our fleet managed to find a route around this continent into another ocean. An ocean so calm, they decided to name it Taiping - the tranquil one, to celebrate the peaceful world under the Son of Heaven's rule!\n\nThe Fleet's captain and many other sailors died of exotic illness during the voyage over the Taiping Ocean, but most of our ships survived to eventually find themselves approaching the Land of Rising Sun. After a short last leg our glorious Fleet became the first one to circumnavigate the globe as it arrived back in its own home port."

With signs and gestures towards his gold-and-silver insignia the natives relayed that precious metals came from the northwest, from a tribe most aggressive and warmongering.
