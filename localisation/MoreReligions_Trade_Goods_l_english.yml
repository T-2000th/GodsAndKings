 mr_prices.1.t: "Hopped Beer"
 mr_prices.1.d: "Until relatively recently, beer was flavored with local herbs and flora - some common ones being ivy, mugwort, and yarrow. This combination of plant additions was known as gruit and common in beermaking throughout Europe. Local flora would impart its own special flavor upon each region's brews with the addition of berries and other spices. In recent years, the practice of adding hops has caught on and spread throughout brewer's communities in Europe. Hops is a particular plant originating in Germany, known to have several medicinal qualities; more importantly, it imparts a distinct flavor in beer and stability during brewing. Law concerning the usage of either gruit of hops varied by jurisdiction and taxatable product is an especially motivating factor on wheter hops is adopted, but it is clear to see that hops are here to stay."
 mr_prices.1.a: "I'll drink to that!"
 
 mr_prices.2.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Purity Law of [GetYear]"
 mr_prices.2.d: "The Purity Law was concieved in [Root.GetName] as a standards for the improvement of the quality of beer in their own breweries. Similar laws were quickly adopted in nearby realms, and soon the Empire itself had decreed its own version in [GetYear]. The general quality of beer had drastically risen across Europe as - sometimes - severe punishments were dealt for breaking the law. None of this would have been possible without the first Purity Law set forth in [Root.GetName]."
 mr_prices.2.a: "Cheers!"
 
 mr_prices.3.t: "Rigish Mead and the Baltic League"
 mr_prices.3.d: "The City of Riga is a bustling metropole inhabited by Christians, Pagans; Germans, and Baltic Peoples. Among them, they have many differences, but all are set aside over a cup of mead. Mead, of course, an alcohol fermented of honey, is the principle drink of Riga. It's familiarity and ubiquity has caught the attention of many a trader hawking their goods in Rigan ports. They bring stories back to home ports of the most delicious drink they partook in Riga; others yet bring souveniers. Mead from Riga, or Rigish Mead, has gained a reputaion of quality drink across Europe by way of Baltic League Merchants."
 mr_prices.3.a: "Now we can charge even more for a premium!"
 
 mr_prices.4.t: "The Rum Ration"
 mr_prices.4.d: "The High Seas are a rough and tough environment where even the hardiest of sailors need something to take the edge off and to find reprieve far from home. A glass of rum lights a fire in the stomach and can provide a warmth reminescent of the family hearth. In addition to bolstering the morale of our men at sea, we can see the benefits of unspoiling and relatively light rations, as well as the promise of a daily imbibment as a motivating factor for recruitment."
 mr_prices.4.a: "Up Spirits!"
 mr_naval_rum: "Naval Rum Ration"

 mr_prices.5.t: "Spiced Skim Milk Cheese"
 mr_prices.5.d: "During the production of butter, skim milk is a runoff byproduct. It is not typically desired and sometimes even given to pigs to fatten them. In the province of [cheese_skim_place.GetName], farmers have developed and interesting method of improving its taste and quality: infusion of spices. The process of impressing these flavors has become the norm with foreign and local spices. The quality improvement is so drastic that the once undesireable cheese has come to match the popularity of mainstream regional cheeses in some communities."
 mr_prices.5.a: "Delicious!"

 mr_prices.6.t: "Pewter Kitchenware"
 mr_prices.6.d: "Pewter is an alloy composed primarily of tin, with smaller amounts of antimony, and silver, copper, or lead. It is a soft, easily malleable material with a silvery luster that has become fashionable amongst not only the nobility but also the merchant class of [Root.GetName]. A plate or knife or spoon are common implments, but even jewelry, teapots, and candlesticks have pewter versions."
 mr_prices.6.a: "I'll take two!"
 
 mr_prices.7.t: "Sculptor's Golden Age"
 mr_prices.7.d: "In [Root.Capital.GetName], famed sculptor [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has attracted aspiring artists from across the country seeking to learn his techniques. He has become renowned as a genius artist who claims that sculpting is 'merely freeing form from the stone.' Upon seeing his works, it is easy to see that [Adm_Advisor.GetName] is understating; fabric falls upon delicately carved bodies and musculature is precisely displayed with such candor it is easy to forget it was once a chunk of stone. Meanwhile, his first students gather around for their first lesson..."
 mr_prices.7.a: "Truly a marvel!"
 
 mr_prices.8.t: "Rice in Europe"
 mr_prices.8.d: "Rice has been known to Europeans for centuries, dating back to possibly even Roman times. It has made resurgences within the continent brought by Arabs in Iberia and Sicilian contact in Africa. Wide scale rice production has never taken hold though because previous regions were not conducive to it.\nItaly however, is well suited, especially the fertile Po valley; and with the increased introduction of rice into Italy from Venetian trade routes to the east, several farmers have made attempts to create their own farms of this exotic grain."
 mr_prices.8.a: "I would like to try some!"
 mr_prices.8.b: "I prefer bread, if its all the same."
 
 mr_prices.9.t: "The Vast Forests of Reisland"
 mr_prices.9.d: "Ever since [Root.Culture.GetName] settlers first set foot in Reisland, they were bewildered by the veritable sea of trees which streched to the horizon and upwards to dizzying heights. These great old growths once served as a boon for colonists building their first settlments but with an established core territory they have begun to export this wood abroad."
 mr_prices.9.a: "Get to building!"
 
 mr_prices.10.t: "Advancements in Structural Engineering"
 mr_prices.10.d: "Churches and temples were once built with time-tested but simplistic methods. As the Egyptians exhibited their spendor and power with great masses of stone, and the Chinese bringing nature to heel with its great canals, it is now us who stand at the forefront of Man's innovation. The great Complex at [big_building.GetName], once a simple place of worship, has been transformed and upgraded with towering structures and impressive facades. The master builder responsible for this impressive feat was educated in the principles of practical Geometry.\n\nPilgrims travel from across the country and beyond to behold the spires which reach for the heavens, and students are being educated under the master builder now."
 mr_prices.10.a: "Magnificent!"
 
 mr_prices.11.t: "Increased Demand for Whale Oil"
 mr_prices.11.d: "Spermaceti is a substance found within the head of a sperm whale, which could yield nearly 2000 liters of material. In the past it was not valued as much as the meat and blubber which could be harvested from the body, but new processing techniques have made it much more useful. It can now be turned into a clean burning and nearly odorless fuel - fantastic for candles, lanterns, and other lighting sources."
 mr_prices.11.a: "Good thing there are so many whales out there!"
 
 mr_prices.13.t: "Ice Houses in [Root.GetName]"
 mr_prices.13.d: "Returning from a journey to Persia, a merchant brought back a curious description of a sort of building which had stood since ancient times. It was a dome-shaped structure shaped in such a way that cooling air would keep things in side at near freezing temperatures. By the request of a wealthy patron, one was built on his estate with the merchant's supervision. The ability to keep ice year round was an appealing prospect - evident in how many were commissioned after the first."
 mr_prices.13.a: "Cool!"
