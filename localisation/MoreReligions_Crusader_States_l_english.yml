  cs_naval_investment_title: "Naval Investment"
  cs_naval_investment_desc: "With our survival over the ages largely dependent on our lifeline by sea to the Christian powers back in Europe, not to mention the money earnt by trade leaving our ports, it is vital for us to have a strong enough fleet to protect ourselves. A bit of proactive investment into a new shipyard would make any naval ambitions much easier for us to achieve."
  cs_powerful_fleet_title: "A Powerful Fleet"
  cs_powerful_fleet_desc: "Now that we have expanded our shipbuilding facilities, we must put them to use and build a powerful squadron of modern warships to project our power across the sea! Furthermore, if [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes to, perhaps, invade any neighboring principalities, a squadron of transports and war galleys to protect them would be a great boon."
  cs_raiding_menace_title: "Raiding Menace"
  cs_raiding_menace_desc: "With our fleet too powerful to be challenged by any of the Muslim powers in the Eastern Mediterranean, no one can stop us from making like the Knights of St. John or Berbery Pirates and raid coastal regions for our own benefits."

  cs_masters_of_the_mediterranean_desc: "Our navy is without equal in the Mediterranean, and we have mastered the arts of seamanship and naval combat in its unique waters, and begun branching out to the use of heavier ships as expected of a true great power."

  ati_old_claims_title: "Dynastic Ties"
  ati_old_claims_desc: "There is a long history of intermarriage for alliances between all the Christian Princes of the East, but we in Antioch have enjoyed pride of place as the strongest Prince of Outremer since the collapse of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and combined with our physical proximity, have enjoyed the closest ties to our neighbors in Little Armenia--Cilicia. In these dangerous times, those dynastic ties mean we have plausible claims through not just one but several family lines to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]; when Antioch was strong, Cilicia was often reduced to a vassal state or administered directly by a governor appointed by the Prince. We should replicate this arrangement."
  ati_older_ties_title: "Older Ties"
  ati_older_ties_desc: "The Kingdom of Sicily is ruled by the \"main\" branch of the House of Hauteville. If we were to strengthen our recent ties to the senior Hautevilles--or perhaps dig up some \"iron-clad\" claims with some thorough investiation--to the throne of Sicily, we could seek to make ourselves the new heads of the dynasty, and don't we deserve that?"
  ati_older_ties_trigger_tt_1: "We have a §Yroyal marriage§! with @SIC §YSicily§! or @TTS §YTwo Sicilies§! and they have §G+150§! opinion of us."
  ati_older_ties_trigger_tt_2: "@SIC §YSicily§! or @TTS §YTwo Sicilies§! is our rival and we have a spy network of strength §Y80§! in them."
  ati_older_ties_effect_tt: "If @SIC §YSicily§! or @TTS §YTwo Sicilies§! exists and is independent, we will gain a §YRestoration of Union§! CB on them with a duration of §G10§! years. Furthermore, if we have a royal marriage with them, we will gain a spirit negating the §Ystab loss when declaring war§!. \n\nOtherwise, we will gain §Ypermanent claims§! on all of §YSicily§!."
  ati_springboard_to_taranto_title: "Springboard to Taranto"
  ati_springboard_to_taranto_desc: "With Sicily under our control, the old lands of our forefather lie just across the waters of the Sicilian Channel, the last step we'd need to establsih our claims to true greatness."
  ati_both_homes_of_bohemond_title: "Both Homes of Bohemond"
  ati_both_homes_of_bohemond_desc: "With our ancestral home in control, none can say we are not a great European house and a player in continental politics. In fact, meddling in the politics of Italy was a favorite occupation of the Normans of old, including extorting favors from the Pope. Perhaps it is time we pay His Holiness a visit..."
  ati_both_homes_of_bohemond_effect_tt: "We will no longer receive the §YPapal Subjugation§! §Rmalus§! for, well, subjugating the @PAP Pope."

  edd_old_claims_title: "Old Claims"
  edd_old_claims_desc: "These are not exactly our glory dies. In times past, Edessa stretched from just beyond the city of Antioch itself in the west to the Euphrates in the east, north into the Anatolian foothills and south into the plains of Iraq. While that land and the base of power it lent us may have slipped from our grasp, who is to say that the strength of Edessa is yet spent?"
  edd_edessa_ascendant_title: "Edessa Ascendant"
  edd_edessa_ascendant_desc: "Now that we have grown stronger than our old rivals in Antioch, we finally have a chance to succeed in our old ambitions to reunite our realm with theirs. With a little time and preparation, we can prepare a coup so swift none will be able to oppose us."

  cs_a_modern_army_title: "A Modern Army"
  cs_a_modern_army_desc: "The times are changing; military theorists now say that increasingly, cannon rule the battlefield, and they will only grow more important with time. Certainly, we can see their usefulness for sieges, which should make them worth investing in for that reason alone."
  cs_regional_superpower_title: "Regional Superpower"
  cs_regional_superpower_desc: "Our armies are the greatest in the area. It is time to start throwing our weight around."
  cs_regional_superpower_trigger_tt: "Our army is §Glarger§! than every nation whose capital is in the §YMiddle East§! or §YPersia§! super regions."
  cs_holy_armies_title: "Holy Armies"

  # Slot 2
  cs_grant_italian_quarter_title: "Grant Italian Quarter"
  cs_grant_italian_quarter_desc: "Having established strong relations with Italian merchants, they are now interested in establishing more than small trade outposts in our land. If we allow them to establish a trading quarter in our capital, it could have quite beneficial effects in the long term, in addition to reaping a hefty bribe."
  cs_grant_italian_quarter_trigger_TT: "Any Christian, Italian republic has at least §G150§! opinion of us."
  unlock_privilege_estate_burghers_crusaders_grant_italian_quarter_tt: "Unlocks the §YGrant Italian Quarter§! privilege for the §YBurghers§! estate."
  cs_seek_italian_military_support_title: "Italian Military Support"
  cs_seek_italian_military_support_desc: "Now that we granted the Italians a trading concession, by keeping the foreign merchants and our own coexisting in harmony, we can leverage their connections to provide some much needed mercenary aid at a cut-rate price. Rest assured, their quality in battle won't reflect that."
  cs_seek_italian_military_support_reward_TT: "Will unlock a special mercenary company, the Italian Company of Outremer, composed of infantry specialized in ranged combat. This company will be cheaper for us to hire."
  cs_eastern_metropolis_title: "Eastern Metropolis"
  cs_eastern_metropolis_desc: "As the furthest east bastion of Christendom, we have a unique position to become the nexus of new trade networks tying the rest of Europe to the riches of the East. All we need is a friendly Muslim neighbor willing to let us in on the action..."
  cs_eastern_metropolis_TT: "We will gain §G+10%§! Goods Produced in each province in the capital state and an additional §G+0.5§! Goods Produced and bonus tax income in the capital province."
  cs_jerusalem_restored_title: "Jerusalem Restored!"
  cs_jerusalem_restored_desc: "A product of the glorious First Crusade; the Kingdom of Jerusalem was a testament to what the Christian World could achieve when united in heart and goals. Its loss was a tragedy, and its restoration has been the stated goal of many a subsequent crusade.\n\nIt's about time we succeed where our predecessors have struggled, and fulfill our ancestors' noble dreams; it's time for the Kingdom of Jerusalem to return for good!"
  cs_our_claims_achieved_title: "Our Claims Achieved"
  cs_our_claims_achieved_desc: "With Jerusalem restored, it's due time we once more went on the offensive and brought the entirety of Outremer to good Christian hands. By securing these lands we will both gain the strength necessary to protect our hold on Jerusalem, but also establish our place as a true force to be reckoned with in the East."

  cs_expand_our_demesne_title: "Expand Our Demesne"
  cs_expand_our_demesne_desc: "Once we have expanded our realm significantly, it will take our claims of preemince from mere words to evidenced thought and deed; in short, a fact. Outremer is a small land, and the Christian part smaller still, so this task is not as great as it may first seem, for the other Princes have few places to look for friends when our armies come marching."

  # Diplomatic path
  cs_first_among_equals_title: "First Among Equals"
  cs_first_among_equals_desc: "Among all the surviving Lords of the Outremer, a common title has been adopted--ever since the foolish Counts of Tripoli were forced to abandon their prententions to Baldwin's Crown--that of Prince. Nominally, thus, we are all peers in these harsh lands, despite the wealth and prestige of Antioch and the military vigor of Edessa.\n\nIn order to begin the path to greatness, the diplomats of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court must range far and wide, spreading gifts, flattering egos, and making subtle insinuations of our future plans to receptive ears, all to establish our preeminent reputation and prestige among all the Christian courts of the East."
  cs_first_among_equals_effect_tt: "Due to our winning charm, any Prince of Outremer who considers us a rival and has a positive opinion of us will set aside their childish petulance. Any Prince of Outremer whose opinion of us is at least §G+100§! will become a historical friend."
  cs_royal_dowries_title: "Royal Dowries"
  cs_royal_dowries_desc: "Many of the differences between the Outremer princes have now been resolved, but if we want this climate of peace and co-operation between the Christian realms to last beyond our own lifespans- we must be proactive in nipping future schemes in the bud.\n\nBy marrying into the various Houses of Outremer, and by keeping... 'close tabs'... on the inner workings and dirty secrets of their courts, we will be doing our part in the perpetuation of peace in the Holy Land."
  cs_royal_dowries_trigger_tt: "We have a §Yroyal marriage§! with or a §Yspy network§! of strength §G80§! in all other Princes of Outremer."

  cs_peace_with_heathens_desc: "By proving we are willing to work with local religious leaders and live alongside our heathen subjects, rather than living in perpetual holy war against them, we can make our realm much more stable and able to grow beyond a small toehold next to the coast."
  cs_a_stable_society_title: "A Stable Society"
  cs_a_stable_society_desc: "Outremer has long been plagued by war, poverty, and factional infighting, as both a result of and continuing cause for the long, slow decline of the Christian lands despite the disunity and chaos among the infidels as well. If we can provide a true sense of security to our people, it will not only give us renown within the region, but allow continued peaceful development into a prosperous realm."
  cs_eastern_exports_title: "Eastern Exports"
  cs_eastern_exports_desc: "With our prosperity and economic output, we have assumed a dominant trade position in the eastern Mediterranean.

  cs_thriving_trade_desc: "Where once we subsisted on meager incomes from grain harvested in ravaged lands and the minimal tithes we could afford to charge the Italians--lest they take their trade and naval power elsewhere, we have now stabilized and rebuilt the prosperity of Outremer. With the flow of trade goods from East to West increasingly directed through our bustling towns with their strong walls and tidy ports rather than the overland route through dangerous Anatolia or across the harsh Sinai Desert to Egypt, we stand poised to become truly wealthy."
  cs_land_of_milk_and_honey_title: "Land of Milk and Honey"
  cs_land_of_milk_and_honey_desc: "The Wars between us and the Saracens have seen the prospering lands of the Levant depopulated and underutilised. In the days of Rome, Syria and Palestine were rich, fertile territories that financed the wars of many a great leader; having restored our trade ties to Europe and Persia, we are on the precipice of bringing our heartland back to its past greatness, and perhaps taking this Promised Land on to even greater heights!"
  cs_syrian_dominance_title: "Syrian Dominance"
  cs_syrian_dominance_desc: "We have done much to develop and enrich the core of our kingdom, both by conquest and by shrewd leadership, but now it is time for our holy armies to march forth and assert our dominance. If we can develop a stranglehold on the trade flowing throughout the [Root.Capital.GetSuperRegionName], then who is to say we are not the rightful masters of all of it?"
  cs_strike_east_title: "Strike East"
    cs_strike_east_desc: "Across the desert from where we currently stand lie the vast and fertile lands of Mesopotamia; home of the ancient Babylonian kings and the beating heart of many a Biblical Empire. Furthermore, on the far bank of the Tigris river sits Ctesiphon, the ancient Sassanian capital, and Persia beyond.\n\nThe ancient and continual rival of all great powers in the Eastern Mediterranean, in Persia lies our destiny. For history has shown, those who would rule in Syria but not also Mesopotamia and Media are doomed to fail. Thus, we must push to the edge of Persia's formidable defenses and prepare for a campaign not seen since the days of Heraklius and Alexander."

  # Slot 5

  cs_looming_mamluks_desc: "The Mamluks are the great and ever-present menace looming above our small principality, threatening always to push us and all Christians into the sea if we let our guard down. Constantly, their cavalry raid outlying settlements, pillaging and taking captives, and their tariffs on trade are beyond extortionate, when they aren't deciding to block caravans entirely. If we are to prosper, we must find a way to stop them from pushing us around."
  cs_agricultural_centralization_title: "Agricultural Centralization"
  cs_agricultural_centralization_desc: "As our prosperity grows, many magnates and landowners have been watching with growing interest and envy the success of the plantations built in the agricultural regions of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lands. Some have already begun to emulate us, but if we were to officially encourage such a policy and sweep any legal hurdles of \"long-standing rights\" and such from the peasantry aside, we could reap a great benefit from the growing productivity."
  cs_agricultural_centralization_effect_tt: "All provinces with §Yfarm§! or §Ypasture§! trade goods will become eligible for a pulse event that will allow you to change the trade good to a valuable export crop.\n\n All owned provinces with a farm or pasture trade good will receive the §YPlantation Economy§! modifier until the end of the game."
  cs_production_focused_economy_title: "Productive Economy"
  cs_production_focused_economy_desc: "Trade alone cannot be allowed to dictate the wealth of peoples, for should the whims of the markets change even the slightest bit, the livelihoods of thousands may be jeopardized--and who needs *more* angry peasants?

  cs_trade_hoarding_title: "Trade Hoarding"
  cs_trade_hoarding_trigger_tt: "Have at least §G50§! ducat trade value in our home trade node. For every additional §Y25§! ducat value, we will gain the §YMany Manufactories§! modifier for another 25 years!"
  cs_trade_hoarding_desc: "We find ourselves strategically positioned in the confluence of the Silk and Spice trades, where the European and Asian markets collide and where the wealth of both accumulate en-masse. This wealth is one we cannot allow to be funneled away however--be it by the Greeks and Turks or the greedy Italians or even the Berbers of North Africa; this money can be used to further our cause and to bring civilisation to these uncouth lands, and it is thus our moral obligation to keep it for ourselves."

  mrCrusaderEvents.2.d: "In doubtless the diplomatic triumph of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reign thus far, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has managed to secure marriage alliances with all the other Princes of Outremer. Furthermore, though the betrothals were not announced all at once, the nuptials are to be held in a single massive ceremony in [Root.GetCapitalName] in three weeks. Rumor has it that notables will be coming from as far afield as Italy and France to witness the spectacle. The only remaining question is how we should prepare for the celebrations..."

  mrCrusaderEvents.4.d: "The agricultural revolution has spread to [This.GetName], with plantation complexes dotting the hillsides, hedges and fences clearly marking the fields, and hordes of disposessed tenants pouring into the towns. With all this upheaval, there's potential to reorient the economy from the old staple produce and herding to valuable cash crops."

  mrCrusaderEvents.5.d: "\"Awake! Alarm! Awake!\"\nThe cry was soon echoing from the palace throughout the neighborhoods of Antioch, but frightened citizens remained in their homes as troops of horsemen without banners thundered down the streets. First smoke, then great tongues of flame rose from the Prince's Palace on the foothills of Mount Silpius to lick the sky, casting an orange hue on the maille of the ominous riders gathering in squares and watch towers. While the citizens nearest the palace hurried to bring water from the wells and stop the blaze from spreading, they failed to notice the signals spreading from Southern Gate and adjacent towers in the city walls, until the whole city was encircled.\n\nBy the morning, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was in the city with another thousand men-at-arms in gleaming armor, carrying the yellow banner of Edessa. Calmly, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] directed the citizens and some of [Root.Monarch.GetHersHis] own men in putting out the last of the fires and beginning to clear debris as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The few troops not dead or bribed, still loyal to the fallen [ATI.Monarch.GetTitle] of Antioch were holed up in the citadel, but it was only a matter of time before they surrended to the eery calm that had befallen the rest of the city."

As the (official) supreme authority over all of God's flock from the Bosporus to Alexandria, including being above our own local bishops, this can have a serious effect on our rule among the faithful, and, more importantly, our influence with the Holy See back in Rome.\n\nThankfully, as we have maintained good relations with the Pope, His Holiness has seen fit to appoint a former Antiochean bishop that we have a good relationship with."
  mrCrusaderEvents.7.a: "Splendid!"

  mrCrusaderEvents.8.t: "New Papal Legate Arrives"
  mrCrusaderEvents.8.d: "His Holiness has appointed a new papal legate to serve the people of Outremer. As the (official) supreme authority over all of God's flock from the Bosporus to Alexandria, including being above our own local bishops, this can have a serious effect on our rule among the faithful, and, more importantly, our influence with the Holy See back in Rome.\n\nBecause our relations with the Holy See are merely a polite formality, we have been given yet another Italian prelate hoping to run out his time and enrich himself on the tithes of our people before returning to Rome to be made a Cardinal somewhere. Perhaps if we were to improve the Pope's opinion of us, we could get a better deal next time..."
  mrCrusaderEvents.8.a: "Okay."
  mrCrusaderEvents.8.b: "We can work with this."

  mrCrusaderEvents.9.t: "New Papal Legate Arrives"
  mrCrusaderEvents.9.d: "His Holiness has appointed a new papal legate to serve the people of Outremer. As the (official) supreme authority over all of God's flock from the Bosporus to Alexandria, including being above our own local bishops, this can have a serious effect on our rule among the faithful, and, more importantly, our influence with the Holy See back in Rome.\n\nDue to our bad relations with His Holiness, he has pawned off the half-wit third son of some German duke on us. The man is haughty, ignorant, and likely to agitate our own people almost as much as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
  mrCrusaderEvents.9.a: "Wonderful..."
  mrCrusaderEvents.9.b: "Make him an offer he can't refuse."
  mrCrusaderEvents.9.c: "Unworthy sons are the easiest to manipulate."

  mrCrusaderEvents.10.t: "Fate of the Kaaba"
  mrCrusaderEvents.10.d: "Now that the Moslem holy city of Mecca, and its Great Mosque, the Masjid al-Haram, are in our hands, it has become a heated debate in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court as to what is to be done with the mosque and the great black cube, or Kaaba, in its heart. The inhabitants of the city have been restive since our soldiers first marched in, many standing an eternal vigil over the mosque, some wailing prayer between tears and sobs while others clutch weapons beneath their robes with stony, silent determination.\n\nOf course, the nobles and clerics of the Sarraceni alternately beg [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to treat the site with respect out of the goodness of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart and threaten of the terrible reprisals that will be out of their hands if we were to desecrate the site. They ask that [Root.Monarch.GetName] order a symbolic cleaning and restoration to soothe population and that over time the Moslems will accept our suzerainty over their most holy place as long as we are fair stewards. Some moderate advisors of the court agree with the Sarraceni, while others (including the Papal legate) insist we not sully our reputation and dabble in dangerous sacrilege by indulging the Moslems this far. All, however, agree that destroying the site is out of the question."
  mrCrusaderEvents.10.a: "Guardian of the Kaaba would make a fine addition to my titles!"
  mr_crusader_guardian_of_the_kaaba_req_TT: "We will be able to upgrade and gain benefits from the §YKaaba§! monument. Once we upgrade it to Tier 2, we will gain additional benefits!"
  mrCrusaderEvents.10.b: "I will have nothing to do with it!"

  mrCrusaderEvents.12.t: "Raiding Yields Spoils"
  mrCrusaderEvents.12.d: "As our raiding parties bring back more and more loot, it has a beneficial effect on our own coastal communities, who reap a share of the spoils, and more from the cash-flush sailors and marines spending time in the port towns."
  mrCrusaderEvents.12.a: "I love piracy!"
