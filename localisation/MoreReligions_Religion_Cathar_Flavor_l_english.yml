 cathar_flavor.1.t: "[TOU.Monarch.GetName] [TOU.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], The Cathar King"
 cathar_flavor.1.d: "The years after the failed Cathar Crusade proved to be difficult for the Counts of Toulouse, who were accused by The Church of alligning themselves with heretics. Although officially Catholic, it was difficult to dispute that the House of Toulouse made little attempt to reign in the spread of Catharism in Southern France, favoring the loyalty and mutual gains of protecting their subjects. Count Raymond VI and his predecessors were known to play the diplomatic game, lending their support to the King of France and the Papacy in Crusades and other regional conflicts; it was this lip-service which allowed a tenouous continuity over Southern France.\n\nIn recent times, [TOU.Monarch.GetTitle] [TOU.Monarch.GetName] has shown disinterest in continuing these disingenuous games, owing his lack of trust in the Church to his forefathers. With Catharism still simmering under his rule, his conversion would prove to be a great boon to centralizing his domain, but the consequences could be dire."
 cathar_flavor.1.a: "Political matters should never trump Spiritual Matters!"
 cathar_flavor.1.b: "It is a matter of pragmatism, not faith."
 
 cathar_flavor.2.t: "Judgement Day is Nigh"
 cathar_flavor.2.d: "In the many years since the Cathar Crusades, Catharism has taken on an almost pessimistic theological outlook, greatly influenced by a specific sect within the Cathar community. In their view, the massacres and torture which precipitated during the Crusade were seen only as a precursor to the Day of Reckoning. Of course, with most Cathars forbidding killing, self-defense was a non-starter, so many Cathar 'perfecti' - spirtual leaders - have come to the logical conclusion that 'endura' has become the only solution.\n\nWhich is to say, suicide as a virtue.\n\nWhile still a minority belief, the outlook of the Cathars may develop towards this extrema, either by outsider 'pressure' or domestic radicalization."
 cathar_flavor.2.a: "We will find our way to Heaven, one way or another."
 cathar_disaster_explanation: "§YJudgement Day§! Disaster is now active.\n\n§RIf Judgement Day occurs, the results will be catastrophic.§!"
 
 cathar_flavor.3.t: "The Sin of Livestock"
 cathar_flavor.3.d: "The Cathar view is that all products of sexual intercourse or killing are sinful, ruling out the consumption of dairy and meats. \nFish, of course, are exempt from this, as they are spawned spontaneously in rivers."
 cathar_flavor.3.a: "We will make bread"
 cathar_flavor.3.b: "We harvest the fields"
 cathar_flavor.3.c: "We pick from the trees"
 
 cathar_flavor.4.t: "A Woman Perfect"
 cathar_flavor.4.d: "Catharism does away with the arbitrary hierarchies the Church enforces on others; all people are free to preach and practice as long as their piety is just. It is this egalitarian organization that has attracted so many women - former catholics or otherwise - to the faith."
 cathar_flavor.4.a: "We welcome all scholars!"
 cathar_flavor.4.b: "We welcome all preachers!"
 
 cathar_flavor.5.t: "The Sin of Fishing"
 cathar_flavor.5.d: "The Cathar view is that all products of sexual intercourse or killing are sinful, ruling out the consumption of dairy and meats. \nWhile most Cathars practice pescatarianism, the community in [cathar_fish_province.GetName] believe the consumption of fish to also be sacrilegious and that they should be treated with the same respect all other living creatures recieve - despite being the product of spontaneous generation."
