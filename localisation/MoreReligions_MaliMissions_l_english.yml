mr_mali_exploration_fourteen_desc: "When we first heard from our guide about the Tawantinsuyu, we thought it must have been simply an exaggeration. The mountains of the west have only been partially mapped, and from what the Musica and Ansari say, they are taller than any hill in our homeland, their great peaks piercing into the clouds above. We thought it was simply impossible for people to live there, let alone a great civilization.\n\nAnd yet - when our men walked through their great roads, when we saw their fields carefully placed along the cliffsides, and witnessed their temples of stone and gold, we were shocked. Here, at the furthest edge of the world, was an empire unlike any other - a kingdom in the sky, Kulubio. Upon hearing this, the Emir of Bakirio sent for the Ansari with over six hundred of his own men into this land, with orders to make them genuflect at the feet of the Mansa. Despite their apparent power and might, none so far have withstood the might of Mali, and they shall be no exception."
