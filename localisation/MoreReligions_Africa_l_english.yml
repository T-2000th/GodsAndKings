  afr_looming_doom_desc:0 "Once, we held all of the former province of Africa, serving as the vanguard of the Norman Kings of Sicily in the Maghreb. However, when William I ascended to the throne in 1154, the native Muslims split into factions and a pro-Almohad faction managed to systemically undermine our rule, leading to an Almohad invasion. All hope was thought to be lost. However, in our darkest hour, both the pro-African faction of the native Muslims and crusaders from abroad held the Almohads outside the city walls of Tunis. Since then, we have only barely survived thanks to aid from the fragmenting Sicilians and our strategic manuveurs regarding the Almohads and their successors. However, now Sicily has become too weak to aid any longer and the revolt of 1354 has left us nothing more than a city state with the rebels of Kairouan having taken much of what remained, and now openly planning to march on Tunis itself. Let us prepare to face them before we go into the dark night forever."

Only due to the courageous efforts of both Arabs who supported our rule and a coalition of crusaders were we able to hold the Almohads outside the walls of Tunis. In the aftermath, we swore fealty in exchange for being the governors of Tunisia. During this time, we both recieved support from the Almohads and Sicily and played them off each other. However, this only worked as long as the Almohads persisted. Unfortunately, they collapsed, and in the thunderdome that was the Maghreb after their collapse, we found ourselves vulnerable.\n\nA second rebellion then occured in 1354, under the leadership of the the House of Al-Hafsi. We were not fortunate enough to have the aid of anyone as we were pushed back to the city walls of Tunis, to which we have been confined since. It has been 90 years since that rebellion, and we have found ourselves more reliant on outside help to survive, and more vulnerable than ever. The Qayrawan have been too distracted with other affairs to finish the job, but, now that they've stablized their position, it will not be much longer until they finally turn their sights back on those city walls."
