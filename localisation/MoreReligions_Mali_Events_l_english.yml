 mr_MaliFlavor.1.t: "The Second Great Journey"
 mr_MaliFlavor.1.d: "The previous night had been quite the terror. Between the fierce winds and crashing waves, few Malian sailors could sleep peacefully, let alone those manning the sails and steering the mighty vessel. Yet that was not what kept them awake at night. What kept their eyes wide, what kept their stomachs churning, what made them nearly giddy with excitement was what they saw two days prior - Gulls, flying overhead. They were close. So, so very close.\n\nThe next day, the dawn broke. When each sailor rose from their cot they approached the bow of the ship. There, in the distance, they could see it, piercing above the waves. Land. Trees, much like those of the southern Temne lands, stretch over the sandy beaches. As they cried out in joy, these Colonists pressed further until they touched down upon the shores of this new land. They didn’t know it, but they were to become some of the first old world explorers since the vikings of old to actually settle on this new land. They sent one of their ships back, returning for more supplies as they established a camp.\n\nThe Mansa was overjoyed. The new continent had been finally reached by their hands, not just explored and mapped on a page. In a short decree, the Mansa diverted several thousand shells towards this project - their legacy would be one of exploration, colonization, and the discovery of the west."

mr_MaliFlavor.1.a: "Send more colonists to chart out nearby settlements!"
mr_MaliFlavor.1.b: "All of our support must go to the new settlement!"

mr_MaliFlavor.2.t: "The Importation of Sugar"
mr_MaliFlavor.2.d: "Sugar is not native to this new land in the far west. Nor is it native to our homeland, either. It originated from a far eastern land, where the climate is warm and the rains are plentiful. However, this new island of Hayti seems to be a place where we can reasonable grow this crop. We shall take this valuable good and establish our own holding of it in the new world, so that we can dominate the Reisland Trade."
mr_MaliFlavor.2.a: "Bring in the Foreign Sugar Cane!"
mr_MaliFlavor.2.b: "Bring in the Domestic Sugar Cane!"
mr_MaliFlavor.2.c: "Perhaps another time."

mr_MaliFlavor.3.t: "The Binkenedugu Dispute"
mr_MaliFlavor.3.d: "The isle of Binkenedugu was dicovered by the Malian Mansa, Mohammad ibn Qu in the mid 14th Century. But, despite calling the islands lush and green, they never properly settled these lands. Our own sailors, eager to explore this new land, set off on their own. When they settled the islands in 1414, there was some diplomatic grumblings from the Keita line, but we smoothed it over with clever words and charming smiles. Now, they claim ownership over these isles in their ever expansive push to the west. They cite Qu's voyages as a reason, of which they do have some argument, but we remain stedfast in our claim as well. In the end, the Princes of the confederation met and discussed what to do next, and..."

mr_MaliFlavor.3.a: "The isles shall become theirs."
mr_MaliFlavor.3.b: "Their claim holds no merit! Begone!"

mr_MaliFlavor.4.t: "The Princes Respond"
mr_MaliFlavor.4.d: "A breatheless courtier runs into the great Mansa's chambers. Barely able to speak, he bows before relaying the message that the princes deliberated over for days."
mr_MaliFlavor.4.a: "They agreed? A wonderful response!"

mr_MaliFlavor.5.t: "The Farma of Jolof"
mr_MaliFlavor.5.d: "We have recieved a notification from the Mansa of Mali, and quite the shocking one at that. They believe that our relationship of alliance is not suitable enough - they protect us from outside harm and supply us with merchants and traders, so it is far more applicable to call us a territory in their empire. This is not exactly an uncommon thought, and many of our nobles agree that we would fair better against the changing world underneath Malian protection. However, some princes reject this notion, claiming our sovereignty to their dying breath. We must make a decision, lest the Mansa grows impatient."
mr_MaliFlavor.5.a: "Together, we shall see a beautiful new dawn."
mr_MaliFlavor.5.b: "They must be mad. If they want our land, they can come and take it!"

mr_MaliFlavor.6.t: "The Fate of the Confederation"
mr_MaliFlavor.6.d: "We knew our proposal would be audatious. We were asking a confederation of several princes in Jolof to all bend the knee to us in subjugation, to give up their rights and privileges as rulers to be underneath us. However, we also knew that we had every right to press this claim. We are far larger, far more powerful, and far more influential in their secret court meetings than they think. So when our demand was sent, we patiently waited a response. When the messenger arrived, his face was calm - he clearly rehearsed what he was about to say."
mr_MaliFlavor.6.a: "The Confederation shall join the Empire!"
mr_MaliFlavor.6.b: "The fools dare refuse? Time to end this Confederation!"

mr_MaliFlavor.7.t: "A New Land Discovered!"
mr_MaliFlavor.7.d: "Spurred by the great Mohammad Qu's voyages to Binkenedugu, our Mansa [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to launch his own mission to the far west of the world. Utilizing Cordoban ship designs with sailors from the Jolof and Futa Jallon region, these great vessels sailed beyond the currents of the cape, reaching the far west in a matter of months. There, they discovered great forests of green, filled with strange and foreign creatures and people alike. They didn't have supplies to remain, so they returned back with a few captives and trinkets - but that was enough to light the fire of discovery within the Mansa's heart. He ordered new journeys, another great mission filled with gold and farmers, to establish a permanent base in these new colonies. The Malian Age of Exploration has begun!"
mr_MaliFlavor.7.a: "The world just became much larger..."


mr_MaliFlavor.8.t: "The Bakirio Food Revolution"
mr_MaliFlavor.8.d: "Historically, Mali has been primarily focused on the use of basic grains to produce large amounts of food. This is not uncommon for the vast majority of the world - food simply was bland at this point. However, with the introduction of fruits and vegetables like tomato and maize, alongside new spices like sugar and peppers, and with the general wealth afforded to the upper class of the Mandinka, a cuisine revolution took place. Dishes like the classical Jollof Rice became infused with tomatoes to increase the taste, peanut paste and sugar were infused to create dishes such as Maafe, further enhanced by the spices and peppers both local and foreign. The traditional method of sharing food with friends and family alike out of a single plate continues, as the need for quantity is replaced by a desire for higher quality foods."
mr_MaliFlavor.8.a: "Grab a plate - avoid the beans!"

 mr_MaliFlavor.9.t: "A Refreshing Change"
 mr_MaliFlavor.9.d: "With our trade reaching truly global heights, we now incorporate ingredients not only from our local ports but also those of the far away lands of the east. In the coasts of southern asia, a root is grown that carries with it a bitter yet savory taste. This ginger we have incorporated with our Reisland sugars to create the delicious drink called jinjinbere, enjoyed across our empire. We have imported much of the tea to our coastal province of [5210.GetName], where it is grown extensively. Another phenomenon has also occurred, where the importance of tea has led to an explosion of tea shops and cafes dotted along the ports, roads, and in virtually every major city. It is customary for three servings of tea to be had for everyone involved, giving time for conversation and connection to truly arise in these changing and turbulent times."
 mr_MaliFlavor.9.a: "First is life, second is love, and third is death."

mr_MaliFlavor.10.t: "The Food Hegemony"
mr_MaliFlavor.10.d: "With our empire growing larger and larger, there is little keeping our Bambara traditions from spreading throughout most of the wider african continent. From the coasts of the Senegal to the oases of Kanem, our traditions and culture spread far and wide. This can be seen in many different ways, but one curious way is in food. Local regional foods have become blended with our own, so now Jollof Rice can be seen in the lower Niger Delta made by Igbo cooks, putting their own spin and take on the classic dish. Pies and pastries made in the coasts by foreign merchants are now made in some of the wealthier castles in the far northern deserts, while tea is impossible to escape. We have expanded our culture, but have not overtaken the local ones."
mr_MaliFlavor.10.a: "Dig in!"

mr_MaliFlavor.11.t: "A South Reislandia Delicacy!"
mr_MaliFlavor.11.d: "When we landed in the southern reisland states, a curious development began. Throughout all of our settlements, more and more people began buying the maize produced by the local Muscogee, even more than in any other province. Upon investigating this, we discovered that our local population had begun to take the recipe for their meal, commonly known as “Grits”, and had transformed it into a fried delicacy. People from all over the new settlements have been enjoying and devouring these juicy fried goodness - even our own Mansa has taken to devouring them whole. This has led to a slight health problem for our Mansa, but truly, they seem just quite ecstatic about the food - so who are we to judge?"

event_insightMali15: "§GEvent Insight:§! This event will explore the reorganization of the state of @GBI Gobir into a loyal confederation of Hausa States.\n"
mr_MaliFlavor.15.t: "The Fate of the Hausa"
mr_MaliFlavor.15.d: "The House Gobir has risen to be a dominant challenger to the Kanem’s dominance over their fellow Hausan states. Hausaland was, for a time, a series of ever changing power dynamics between the different houses of Kano, Zazzau, Katagum, and many others, However, in the 14th Century, the lords of Kanem sent forth a series of raids to claim subjugation of many of the eastern powers, simultaneously converting many of them to Islam. Gobir stubbornly refused, placing many defenses and fortifications alongside their border with the new Kanem vassals, hoping it would protect them. Little did they know, their real challenge would come from the west.\n\nTheir defeat at the hands of the Mansa was inevitable, but it wasn’t without merit. Their cavalry held firm for many days of battle, and their great walled cities stood strong against our many nights of siege warfare. With their defeat, we have claimed the true protectorate over the Hausa people, and we shall organize their territory into a proper unified state. We shall place a remnant of the Gobir at the head of this confederation in order to ingratiate them into our realm with some peace and dignity, to bring them closer rather than drive them away."
mr_MaliFlavor.15.a: "...now, to integrate the other cities."

mr_MaliFlavor.14.t: "Hausa Hegemony Established"
mr_MaliFlavor.14.d: "With the defeat of the Kanem Empire at the field of battle, we gathered all the Sarki that we now rule over at the capital city of the Hausa, Gobir. While many of them had previous issues or disputes, our presence calmed the princes - or perhaps scared them into silence. Either way, the Sarki were silent as we explained our new plan for the lands of the Hausa-Farma. They will exist within a federation, a combined and unified entity that shall bend the knee to the Mansa but shall be allowed to govern and administer their land as best they desire, and so long as they follow the rules and laws of the Empire and do not attack Muslim merchants or Malian officials, they shall be as they were before - free to rule and govern as they please. The Sakri agreed, and the great Hausan confederation was born on that day under the watchful eye of the Mansa."
mr_MaliFlavor.14.a: "And thus, Hausaland is born!"
mr_MaliFlavor.14.b: "And thus, Hausa is unified!"

mr_MaliFlavor.114.t: "The Hausa Rebellion"
mr_MaliFlavor.114.d: "In the midst of our war, our diplomats have reported good news - the Sakris of Hausa have joined on our side! They seek to rebel against their tyranical overlords and work for us, so we shall use this opportunity to defeat them once and for all!"
mr_MaliFlavor.114.a: "Rally them to our forces!"

mr_MaliFlavor.115.t: "The Fate of Kanem"
mr_MaliFlavor.115.d: "The Sultans of Kanem have been brought to heel - their era of dominating the lands surrounding the great Lake Tchad have come to a close. However, their legacy is one that stretches beyond the setting sun of their empire. Their location at the middle of a trans-Saharan trade network allowed them access to the resources and goods of the West African lands and the ideas and scholars of the far north, particularly in Islam. The Sayfawa dynasty centered its state around its religious practice, defining their military excursions and slave trade through the lens of the faithful versus heretics and heathens. Thus, in the 13th Century, when the Fatimid Dynasty of Egypt sent scholars to secure trade connections, they brought with them the Ismaili tradition of the Hafizi, and brought them into said faith.\n\nMali, on the other hand, was and always has been a Maliki state since its initial conversion to Islam. In our conquest of the region, we have faced severe challenges maintaining control and dominance over the region, partially due to our outwardly hostile rhetoric towards this heretical tradition. While our Mansa can debate with local rulers as much as he wants, these small religious spats have the habit of turning violent when local rulers use it as a justification to revolt against our state. Something must be done to assist in the management of the Kanem Farma."
mr_MaliFlavor.115.a: "Remove the Sayfawa, install a Keita!"
mr_MaliFlavor.115.b: "We shall let sleeping dogs lie, for now."


mr_MaliFlavor.116.t: "The Ooni of Ife Ile"
mr_MaliFlavor.116.d: "The Ooni of the Yoruba are spiritual leaders within their community. Prior to our conquest of the region, they had immense influence over their population, in both the areas of religion and the realm of politics. They are said to have direct communication with the various gods and spirits that inhabit the world, and are looked to for guidance and leadership. We, of course, have no doubt that this is all a folly of the heathens. Only those who have read and mastered the words of the Prophet can give advice that will lead a Mansa to glory and power - but we are not going to disrupt their traditional practice, far from it. By placing an Ooni at the head of the Ife-Ile Farma, we shall quell any potential uprisings within the land, saving us the headache of needing to put down revolts from would-be liberators. We shall respect their traditions, allowing them to continue their practices under a watchful eye - a good Mansa is generous, afterall."
mr_MaliFlavor.116.a: "Bring them into the fold!"

mr_MaliFlavor.18.t: "Kingdom of the Kongo - Friend or Foe?"
mr_MaliFlavor.18.d: "Beyond the three islands of the cape lie the great kingdoms of the Kongo, headed by those under the Nkuwa Lukeni. Our initial contact with them was primarily through merchants and sailors, interacting on the fringes of the empire. After initial contacts, we know that a large-scale invasion on the scale of the Kanem or the Tlemcen would not be as easy as thought - this region is isolated and foreign, we would not be familiar with the territory and could be lured into traps by this highly centralized kingdom. Instead, our mystics argue for a soft hand of diplomacy, using religion as an inroad into working with the Kongo. At the end of the day, the mansa must make a decision."
mr_MaliFlavor.18.a: "Send diplomats - establish communication."
mr_MaliFlavor.18.b: "Map out the land - we shall claim it!"

mr_MaliFlavor.20.t: "The Cowry Shell Economy"
mr_MaliFlavor.20.d: "Inherited from our forerunner the Wagadou Empire, the Cowry shell is our preferred legal tender. Coming from as far away as the Indian ocean and the Pacific ocean, to right in our backyard in the coastal islands off the gulf of Guinea. In a land where gold is a primary trade good, we did not adopt the tradition of metallic coins, and all merchants who wish to do business with the great Malian Empire must learn to accept this simple fact. With our conquest of the isles of the east, we have received a flood of new shells into our economy. While our economists write laws to manage potential inflation, our nobles adorn themselves with cowry jewelry. Foreigners remark that our queens have necklaces and bracelets not covered with diamonds or gold, but with shells. Craftsmen sell gilded crowns to foreign dignitaries to bring back as artifacts of our wondrous culture. This alone has driven the price of these shells sky high, as foreign merchants now scramble to find a supplier. Our empire’s influence is great and mighty, and it all begins with this simple and humble cowry."

mr_MaliFlavor.13.d: "Since the days of Sundiata the Great, our empire has relied on the factions within the state to organize and maintain the empire. But more than merely relying on them, we are simultaneously held hostage by them. The Grand Council has evolved from a supportive aid to the Mansa to a faction that influences succession and can stage small scale rebellions. The Hunter’s Guild manages large portions of the army and has risen to a prominence that they cannot be ignored any longer. Meanwhile, the Foreign Merchants have risen in power within our upper ranks as the faithful rely on scholars and texts that these far off travelers bring. We must placate them in order to survive and advance into the next era with peace and stability."

However, they reside within its capital city that is fundamentally different from them - they are a member of the Ummah while the majority of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] are of a different faith. Complaints are common, but recently, an incredibly influential merchant has approached the Mansa demanding that we deal with the unfaithful, claiming that they recently performed a ritual or tradition too heretical to overlook. Naturally, this was an overstatement to say the least, but pressure has been placed on the Mansa to do something. They demand we lift protections of the non-muslims in the city, and allow their missionaries to do their work, but this could cause extreme backlash."
